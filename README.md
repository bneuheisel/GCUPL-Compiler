# GCUPL-Compiler
This is a working prototype of a functional compiler that analyzes the GCUPL code that I created uniquely for this project. 

This compiler is implemented in the Linux console. The steps are simple:
  1. Ensure that all the files are in the same location on your system.
  2. Open the Linux console.
  3. Use the cd command to change directory to the location of the files.
  4. Follow the commands from the MakeFile:
    a. Make all 
    b. Make mips
  5. Congrats, you just ran a full compiler using the input test.gcupl code. Run "Make clean" to restore the compiler to default contents.
